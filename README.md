1. [Classify spam/ham with data from machine learning repository using scikit tfidvectorizer](https://github.com/NAnnamalai/practice_machine_learning/blob/master/classifying_spam_ham.ipynb "Classify spam/ham with data from machine learning repository using scikit tfidvectorizer")
    * load data, preprocess by removing stopwords, punctuations and lowercase all the characters.
    * check the data actual spam, ham counts, get top words related to spam/ham.
    * vectorize the text by tfidvectorizer, since it performs better than countvectorizer.
    * fit the vectorized matrix into randomforestclassifier, multinomialNB and compare the results
